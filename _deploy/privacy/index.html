From time to time, Pippal Labs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Pippal Labs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs.

<p>Certain visitors to Pippal Labs’s websites choose to interact with Pippal Labs in ways that require Pippal Labs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pippal Labs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
