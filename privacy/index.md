From time to time, Pippal Labs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Pippal Labs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Pippal Labs only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
